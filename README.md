# Password 
A simple WPF application that allows the user to register details and simulate the password validations checking using the Chain of Responsibility design pattern.


## What I learn from this project
    1. Build an application from scratch.
    2. How to use navigation to transfer data from one view to another.
    3. Implemented the Chain of Responsibility design pattern.
